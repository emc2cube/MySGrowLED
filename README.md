This module allow you to:
- control a primary LED light (5-40V input used to power the module)
- control a secondary circuit designed for a CPU PWM fan but can be used for a second light
- monitor onboard temperature using an optional DS18b20 sensor
- monitor external temperature by plugging external OneWire sensors
- monitor any additional I2C module such temperature, humidity, light levels, barometric pressure, etc...
